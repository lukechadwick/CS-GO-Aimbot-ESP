# CS-GO-Aimbot-ESP
Research project into how hackers cheat in online games

As a CS:GO player my friend and I are constantly frustrated by the amount of hackers in the game but as a coder curious to how they acheieve this programatically, so I made this as a reasearch project into how aimbots/esp hacks work.

There are two builds:
1. A winforms version that uses a directx library for drawing over the game.
2. A WPF version that uses built-in drawing functions to draw over the game.

Main features are:
1. Aimbot (can aim at different parts of the player skeleton, within an adjustable fov and with adjustable aimspeed etc to look more realistic/human like)
2. ESP (draw box/circle around players through walls.
3. Recoil/Spray pattern compensation.
4. Trigger bot (fire as player passes through crosshair)

The code is messy but works, not really gonna be working on this as I acheived what I wanted to learn.

Not for use online, you will get banned and rightly so.
Many bots were harmed in the making of this app.
